# SplittingMethods
MATLAB code for numerical simulation of charge transfer by stationary and moving discrete breathers in nonlinear lattices modeled with semi-classical Hamiltonian dynamics. Using the code and developed explicit and semi-implicit structure-preserving splitting methods, please cite Bajārs, J., Archilla, J.F.R.: *Splitting methods for semi-classical Hamiltonian dynamics of charge transfer in nonlinear lattices*. Mathematics **10**(19), 3460 (2022), [DOI:10.3390/math10193460](https://www.mdpi.com/2227-7390/10/19/3460).

File `SplittingMethods_PureCode_WithoutData.zip` contains pure code without precomputed data and images.
