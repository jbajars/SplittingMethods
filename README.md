# SplittingMethods
MATLAB code for numerical simulation of charge transfer by stationary and moving discrete breathers in nonlinear lattices modeled with semi-classical Hamiltonian dynamics. Using the code and developed explicit and semi-implicit structure-preserving splitting methods, please cite Jānis Bajārs, *Locally-symplectic neural networks for learning volume-preserving dynamics*, Journal of Computational Physics **476**:111911, 2023 ([DOI: 10.1016/j.jcp.2023.111911](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021999123000062?via%3Dihub)).
